Modules are of two types ES module and common js(CJS)
By default all modules are created in common js 
export and import are not  used in common js

if we have to use import & export we have to convert it to ES module
we use "type": "module" in package.json or 
if we don't have package.json we can give all files extension as .mjs where we want to use import & export
