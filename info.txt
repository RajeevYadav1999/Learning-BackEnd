                     Module Structure

 Module can be considered as a block of code that provide a simple or complex functionality that can communicate with external application. Modules can be organized in a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders.                     

Modules are of two types ES module and common js(CJS)
By default all modules are created in common js 
export and import are not  used in common js

if we have to use import & export we have to convert it to ES module
we use "type": "module" in package.json or 
if we don't have package.json we can give all files extension as .mjs where we want to use import & export
